<p>Kylie jenner�s baby daddy, 29, deactivated his profile on sunday after trolls compared his brown batman outfit to a flea or a ups batman. “mannnn i see a roach tf,” someone weighs him down, another echoes sentiments, “i’m still howling on that outfit. A third person added, “i can’t stop laughing at the batman travis scott costume.” others compared travis’ appearance to a cockroach due to the brown color of the costume. The shape and style of the costume appeared in line with 1992 batman returns� take on the outfit, but the color was, well, a bit off. American rapper travis scott was one of the many celebs to share their halloween 2020 costumes on instagram, but his got more attention than he was possibly hoping for.</p>

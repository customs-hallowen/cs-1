<p>It recently held its first test screening for an audience of around 200 moviegoers. Allyson’s mother and father have both been killed by michael so i really think that they are building to her going off the deep end and embracing the dark.

Now these aren’t from a confirmed source so, we are taking them with a grain of salt for now, but the comments are dang exciting. And today, hdn has confirmed that the first test screening will take place tonight in los.</p>

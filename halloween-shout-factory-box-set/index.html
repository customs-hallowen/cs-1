<p>So i have the shout halloween box set and i was wondering if there are any extra bonus features that are on the single shout releases that are not present in the box set? The tv version of halloween ii was on the scream factory bd, h20 is available from germany/italy/canada in the oar. My set arrived woot, can�t wait to jump right into the magnum opus that is jason x and then work my way from the first. Most of you will probably skip down to the a/v and supplemental sections of this review, or maybe scroll through in order to click on all the screencaps. Never thought i�d say that about a scream factory sale!</p>

<p>A box set of all 10 movies, for their scream factory line. At least in the states. Only the first couple movies have ever been watched so the disc are in excellent condition. So i have the shout halloween box set and i was wondering if there are any extra bonus features that are on the single shout releases that are not present in the box set? The good folks at anchor bay and scream factory have joined forces to create the closest thing to a definitive halloween box set we’re ever likely to get, including all 8 of the movies spawned from john carpenter’s classic original and both of rob zombie’s reboot efforts.</p>

<p>A box set of all 10 movies, for their scream factory line. Factory announced they�d brokered a deal with anchor bay (and multiple other rights holders) to make the impossible possible: The region a locked, bd50 disc is housed inside the normal blue case with brand new reversible cover art and a cardboard slipcover. The tv version of halloween ii was on the scream factory bd, h20 is available from germany/italy/canada in the oar. The good folks at anchor bay and scream factory have joined forces to create the closest thing to a definitive halloween box set we’re ever likely to get, including all 8 of the movies spawned from john carpenter’s classic original and both of rob zombie’s reboot efforts.</p>

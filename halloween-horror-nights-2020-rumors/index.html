<p>We’ve also updated the title to remove the word “rumors” and replace it with “confirmed.” twitter was abuzz last week with rumors of a modified halloween horror nights event for 2020. Fans were sad when the regular event was canceled earlier this. The event will once again feature 10 haunted houses, 5 scare zones, and live entertainment. What a crazy halloween season 2020 has proven to be. If it does happen there will be social distancing changes for sure.</p>

Universal studios remains operational during the day and transitions to halloween horror nights at night. Breaking signage stands for rumored 2020 halloween horror nights houses operating during park hours now up at universal studios florida wdw news today. Following up with yesterday’s rumor on the possibility of two halloween horror nights houses opening during regular park hours at universal studios florida, new signage stands have popped up where the entrances would normally be to soundstage 22 (the location of last year’s ghostbusters house) and soundstage 24 (the location of last year’s yeti and us houses.)</p>

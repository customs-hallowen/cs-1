<p>With donald pleasence, jamie lee curtis, tony moran, nancy kyes. The rating of 18 is understandable due to the violence and gore in the movie (image: Part viii, and all three were notable financial and critical disappointments. Satisfying horror sequel has tons of blood, strong language. The age (australia) top critic.</p>

<p>As much i hate to say this, i’m not sure that david gordon green, danny mcbride and the people behind a new sequel to john carpenter’s “halloween” really understand what made the first film a masterpiece. Still, this classic stands the test of time and is a fun movie for the whole family to get into the halloween mood. While green�s halloween is far more graphic than carpenter�s original when it comes to violence, it also relies heavily on suspense filmmaking techniques that are similar to those employed by its predecessor. It runs for 1 hour and 46 minutes and it�s age rating is 18. The age (australia) top critic.</p>
